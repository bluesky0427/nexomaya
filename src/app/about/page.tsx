              Nexomaya Technology Group began in the IT industry. Technology was our
              starting point, our foundation, and the core through which our
              company first grew.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as we continued to build, collaborate, and lead, we came to
              understand something important: technology is not limited to
              software, computers, or digital systems. True technology is the
              practical use of knowledge, skill, tools, and cooperation to solve
              problems and create value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Nexomaya Technology Group works beyond the boundaries of IT
              alone. We connect people from different industries, backgrounds,
              and areas of expertise to create new opportunities and new forms
              of value.
